# OOP Questions

## What are the 4 pillars of OOP
Abstraction - when you only show the necessary details to the user. They dont need to know the inner mechanisms of what is going on. we only expose the necessary details and hiding the irrelevant information. like when we use .toLowerCase
    complex actions in simple verbs
Encapsulation - binding data and methods together that belong logically together, to kinda help keep responsibility where it belongs
Inheritance - Inheritance is when a class can inherit attributes and methods from a parent class
Polymorphism - Dog parent class and our Puppy child class. This Dog class has a talk() method which will print out “Woof!”. This method will be inherited by the Puppy class. However, this is a small puppy that does not have a strong bark yet. We can modify the talk() method to print out “awoo” instead.



## Provide an example of each
Abstraction
Encapsulation - Private vs Global
Inheritance - Animals (parent child class)
Polymorphism - mom and kid look and act the same but like different things
